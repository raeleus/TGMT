When all this blows over, you'll be reunited with your true love. You two can discard this harlot together. But why did he immediately turn to hostility? Why no explanation? There is no time to think about that. Jennifer is forcing her way in. If you don't make a decision quickly, she'll make it for you.\n\n[#fcfb72ff]\"Look at the meter!

There is no way this used to be one of your crewmates. Boils on the skin bursting with puss. Protruding bones where none should be. And the reproductive organs gone.\n\nYou don't have time to process this horror you've witnessed. You're busy hopping into the cockpit of the short range fighter craft. But how are you going to take off? There is no sign of Jennifer and the bay doors remain shut. You close the swinging hatch just in time as the creature throws itself against the transparent metal.\n\nYou make the mistake of locking eyes with the beast. You see its scleras drip with yellow ooze. The very sight of you only enrages the monster further.\n\nYou're flipping switches left and right, hoping to turn on the machine. To do something. Anything. The creature begins to pound the hatch. Though these crafts are hardened against ballistic assault, you can't help but think the animal's wild fervor will somehow puncture the hull and leave you to suffocate to death.\n\nThen you remember the hologrammer! \"Nate, come in! Nate I'm in the craft!\" Nothing but static. It seems these hologrammers don't do well with the electrical interference of the vessel. You continue to press buttons, turn dials, rub orbs.\n\nAn electronic voice chirps up: \"weapon systems online\". Yippee! You grab what appears to be a trigger and let loose a hailstorm of bullets. You witness the sheer devastation of the deck, but the creature is not in range of your firepower. You tug on the joystick into the direction of the baddie, though you are only met with the clanging of the guns against their housing.\n\nThis whole time you've been pulling on the trigger. An amazing light show of sparks and fire continues to erupt before your eyes. A meter beeps \"heat level critical\".\n\nIt's all coming back to you now. The book! It talked about ejecting the heat dampeners to cause an explosion. Surely that would be devastating to the ship, but with the craft's current orientation it will give you an exit out of the bay.\n\nYou pull the release. WWOOOMP! You have never heard such a deafening wallop before in your entire life. The craft rocks violently from the explosion. The atmosphere of the room immediately escapes to the vast emptiness of space. First, the creature is peeled off of the fighter and thrust into areas unknown. Then the craft begins to bias to its side and is finally shot out into the great darkness.\n\nNow, after being given time to study the controls, you are finally able to activate your rockets and guide the craft to dock with the reactor maintenance hatch."
